            <p class="hero-subtitle">Buses may be slower and often stuck in traffic, but they remain essential for millions—linking neighborhoods the subway doesn't reach and serving as a lifeline for those who depend on transit. Yet fare evasion, sluggish speeds, and rising costs raise a pressing question: how well is the system working for New Yorkers?</p>

                                The NYC bus network faces multiple pressures: ridership is still recovering from the pandemic, fare evasion is climbing, speeds are declining, and costs remain high. At the same time, redesigns and expanded bus lanes suggest ways the system can improve. This report examines buses through four lenses—ridership, performance, efficiency, and finances—to show how the network is performing and where it can be strengthened.

                <p class="section-intro">Fare evasion on NYC buses has surged to record levels, with nearly half of all riders now boarding without paying. This shift has created a two-tier system, where paying passengers are often the minority. The increase—from around 20% pre-pandemic to over 44% today—reflects economic strain, limited enforcement, and outdated fare systems, especially on local routes.
                    Despite efforts like EAGLE Teams and awareness campaigns, evasion remains high. These patterns suggest enforcement alone won't solve the problem.</p>
