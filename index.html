                    New York’s buses carry about a million riders each day, linking neighborhoods that subways often miss. Yet the system has grown slower, less trusted, and more costly over the years. This series examines the data, the budgets, and the politics—and explores what it would take to make the network faster, fairer, and more reliable.

                        <h3></h3>
                        <p>New York City’s buses—once carrying more than two million riders a day—now serve nearly half that number. Today’s 1.1 million daily passengers are disproportionately low-income, immigrant, and essential workers, many earning under $30,000 a year and relying on buses more than the subway. For riders with disabilities, buses are often the only option.</p>
                        
                        <p>Yet the system that carries these riders is fraying. Fare evasion has climbed to record levels, with nearly half of bus trips going unpaid—four times the subway’s rate—draining hundreds of millions in revenue. Enforcement efforts, from EAGLE inspection teams to proof-of-payment scanners, have only made modest dents in the problem.</p>

                        <h3></h3>
                        <p>On the street, buses move at an average of just over 8 miles per hour—slower than any other big-city network in the U.S. In Manhattan, the crawl is closer to 6 mph. Decade after decade, promised improvements have barely nudged the numbers.</p>
                        
                        <p>The result is felt at the curb: more than half of frequent routes suffer delays and bunching, with riders waiting far longer than schedules promise—sometimes two or three times longer. For many, the first bus is too full to board, stretching commutes even further. Pilot programs like busways, all-door boarding, and congestion pricing have shown dramatic improvements, but the question remains: can New York scale those gains across the system?</p>

                    <h3>Fare Evasion</h3>
                    <p>Fare evasion has emerged as one of the most visible symptoms of the system’s strain. The MTA estimates hundreds of millions in lost revenue each year, with buses accounting for a growing share. Yet the reasons riders skip payment are varied. For some, it’s a matter of affordability; for others, it’s frustration with unreliable service or the perception that enforcement is uneven.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cracking down on evasion may recover some funds, but without addressing the underlying drivers—cost, convenience, and trust—fare collection alone won’t restore confidence in the network.</p>

                    <h3>Ridership</h3>
                    <p>Bus ridership in New York has fallen sharply over the past two decades, from nearly 2 million daily riders in 2002 to about 1.1 million today. Annual trips totaled just over 409 million in 2024, still far below pre-pandemic levels, when paid ridership was more than 40 percent higher. The pandemic dealt the hardest blow, with usage dropping to 255 million trips in 2020, and recovery has been gradual since. McKinsey projections for MTA bus ridership have consistently overestimated the pace of this recovery.</p>
                    
                    <p>Who rides matters as much as how many. Bus riders are disproportionately low-income, immigrant, and essential workers: the average household income is under $30,000, more than half of riders are immigrants, and 40 percent work in frontline roles. Buses also carry a greater share of disabled New Yorkers compared with the subway, making them a lifeline for many who cannot easily switch modes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Future growth depends on more than population trends. The MTA projects gradual ridership increases, reaching about three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels by 2026. Yet without more reliable service and faster travel times, even steady gains may not fully restore the system’s role as the affordable, accessible backbone of outer-borough mobility.</p>
