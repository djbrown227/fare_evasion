            <p class="hero-subtitle">Buses may be slower and often stuck in traffic, but they remain essential for millions—linking neighborhoods the subway doesn’t reach and serving as a lifeline for those who depend on transit. Yet fare evasion, sluggish speeds, and rising costs raise a pressing question: how well is the system working for New Yorkers?</p>

              <p class="series-description-1">
                The bus network is shaped by multiple, overlapping pressures: ridership that has yet to fully recover from the pandemic, growing concerns about fare evasion, declining average speeds in a city mired in traffic, and the ongoing strain of operating costs and capital needs. At the same time, recent initiatives—such as redesigned bus networks, bus lane expansion, and the shift toward electric fleets—suggest opportunities for renewal.
                This report takes a structured look at the State of NYC Buses, combining ridership, performance, efficiency, and financial data. Each section addresses a different lens on the system

                <p class="section-intro">Fare evasion on NYC buses has surged to record levels, with nearly half of all riders now boarding without paying. This shift has created a two-tier system, where paying passengers are often the minority. The increase—from around 20% pre-pandemic to over 44% today—reflects economic strain, limited enforcement, and outdated fare systems, especially on local routes.
                    Despite efforts like EAGLE Teams and awareness campaigns, evasion remains high. These patterns suggest enforcement alone won’t solve the problem.</p>
