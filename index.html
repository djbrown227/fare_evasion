            <p class="hero-subtitle">
                New York's bus system is at a crossroads. Ridership has yet to recover, fare evasion 
                is climbing, service is among the slowest in the nation, and costs remain stubbornly high. 
                This four-part series examines the crisis by the numbers, the business of buses, how the 
                system could be rewired, and the equity issues at stake. 
                We begin with Part One: <em>Crisis by the Numbers</em>.

                                New York City's buses are carrying fewer riders than before the pandemic, and nearly half of them now board without paying. At the same time, trips are slowing: buses remain the nation's slowest, with reliability and wait times slipping across the network. This first stage of our series looks at two critical dimensions—ridership and fare evasion in Riding the Numbers, and speed and reliability in On the Move—to understand how the system is faltering, and where improvements are most urgent.

                <p class="section-intro">
                    Fare evasion on New York City buses has surged to <strong>unprecedented levels</strong>, reshaping the way the system operates. In 2024 alone, an estimated <strong>308 million riders</strong> boarded without paying—<strong>nearly half of all bus trips</strong>. What was once a marginal problem before the pandemic, when about <strong>one in five riders</strong> skipped the fare, has become a widespread behavior, with evasion now topping <strong>44%</strong>.<br><br>
                    The shift reflects more than just economics. <strong>COVID-19</strong> disrupted commuting patterns and, for many, <em>loosened the social contract</em> around transit norms. Riders increasingly see buses as a public service they can access <strong>without payment</strong>, a cultural change that enforcement campaigns have struggled to reverse. At the same time, the MTA's <em>aging fare collection technology</em>, inconsistent boarding procedures, and the difficulty of enforcing fares on crowded, open-door buses have made evasion <strong>easier and more visible</strong>.<br><br>
                    Together, these forces have created what some describe as a <strong>"two-tier system"</strong>: paying riders often find themselves in the minority, while non-paying riders form a critical but unacknowledged share of the system's user base. The rise of fare evasion challenges not only the MTA's <strong>finances</strong>, but also deeper questions of <strong>fairness, trust, and how the city values public transit</strong>.

                            <p>
                                Bus ridership in New York City has been in <strong>steady decline</strong> for more than two decades. 
                                Daily riders have dropped from <strong>nearly 2 million in 2002</strong> to just about <strong>1.1 million in 2024</strong> — a loss of roughly <strong>45%</strong>. 
                                This persistent decline reflects lasting shifts in commuting patterns, <em>competition from cars and ride-hailing</em>, and <em>service reliability issues</em>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Brooklyn continues to account for the <strong>highest bus ridership</strong>, while Staten Island carries the <strong>lowest</strong>. 
                                These borough-level differences highlight both the <strong>essential role buses play in certain communities</strong> and the <em>uneven impact of ridership losses</em> across the city.

                            <p>
                                The <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> accelerated these long-term declines. Despite partial recovery, ridership remains <strong>far below pre-2019 levels</strong>. 
                                Daily bus trips hover around <strong>1.4 million</strong>, but commuting patterns have permanently shifted with the rise of <em>remote work</em> and <em>reduced weekday demand</em>.

                            <p>
                                Unlike other transit systems that rely more heavily on subsidies, the MTA depends significantly on <strong>farebox revenue</strong>. 
                                This means falling ridership translates directly into <strong>financial pressure</strong>. Even with projected fare and toll increases through 2027–28, pricing alone cannot close the gap — <strong>ridership losses are structural, not temporary</strong>. 
                                The challenge for the MTA is not simply restoring old patterns, but <em>adapting service to meet new realities</em>.

                    <p>
                        Bus ridership in New York has not just <strong>dipped</strong> — it has <strong>reshaped itself over time</strong>. 
                        The numbers reveal a <strong>long downward trend</strong> that predates the pandemic, with the <strong>COVID years</strong> accelerating changes in <em>commuting behavior</em> and reducing <em>weekday demand</em>.

                        The following charts break this story into three perspectives: <strong>overall ridership decline</strong>, how <strong>weekday ridership today</strong> compares with <em>pre-pandemic norms</em>, and how both <strong>weekday and weekend patterns</strong> deviate from <strong>long-term averages</strong>. 
                        Together, they highlight the <strong>scale and persistence of change</strong> the MTA must adapt to.

                            <p>
                                Over the past decade, New York City buses have failed to speed up — in fact, in many periods they've <strong>slowed down</strong>. 
                                Overall citywide bus speeds declined slightly from an average of <strong>8.22 mph in 2015</strong> to <strong>8.17 mph in 2024</strong>, a drop of about 1%. 
                                Notably, <strong>Staten Island and Queens</strong> saw the sharpest slowdowns — a decline of roughly 8% and 5%, respectively. 
                                In contrast, buses in <strong>Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx</strong> either held steady or barely improved. 
                                While these statistics cover all time periods collectively, it's telling that <em>weekend and off-peak speeds</em> — times when traffic burdens are typically lighter — have nonetheless trended downward since 2015, indicating <strong>worsening service even when conditions should yield smoother bus operations</strong>.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, during the <strong>weekday peak</strong>, when commuters most rely on efficient transportation, bus speeds have essentially <strong>stagnated</strong>, erasing any hope of meaningful recovery. 
                                Despite <strong>congestion pricing</strong> and other attempts to speed transit, weekday peak speeds have remained roughly flat, showing <strong>no substantial improvements</strong> over the same 10-year period. 
                                The consequence is a double blow: at the most critical times for working New Yorkers, buses aren't any faster — even as riders endure <em>longer waits, slower trips, and mounting frustration</em>. 
                                This operational inertia isn't just an inconvenience; it <strong>inches service into irrelevance</strong> and <strong>corrodes trust in public transit</strong> as a viable alternative to cars or other city arteries.

                                Half of New York City's bus routes average <strong>less than 7 mph</strong> — a pace slower than many cyclists. 
                                This is a <strong>profound disservice to working-class New Yorkers</strong>, who make up the vast majority of bus riders. 
                                As rising housing costs push families farther from Manhattan and beyond easy access to subways, they become increasingly dependent on buses. 
                                Yet instead of providing <strong>reliable mobility</strong>, slow speeds <em>steal hours from their days</em>, compounding the challenges of long commutes and adding daily hardship to those already facing economic strain.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Over half of NYC bus lines — those grading a <strong>D or F</strong> in official audits — fall short of basic speed and reliability standards, with many routes crawling <em>slower than walking pace</em> in some boroughs. 
                                This doesn't just frustrate riders — it <strong>actively undermines them</strong>. 
                                Bus users are disproportionately working-class: over 55% are immigrants, most earn <strong>under $30,000 a year</strong>, and they make up the majority of public transit riders. 
                                For these New Yorkers, slow buses don't just waste time — they <strong>deepen economic hardship</strong> by lengthening commutes, cutting into productivity, family time, and rest, and further marginalizing communities already pushed to the city's edges by rising housing costs.

                                New Yorkers can feel it every day: buses are slower and less reliable than they used to be. The numbers back this up. Since 2017, the MTA's own performance metrics show that buses are spending more time stuck at stops (<strong>Additional Bus Stop Time</strong>), riders are experiencing longer-than-expected trips (<strong>Additional Travel Time</strong>), and the odds of a bus arriving on time have dropped (<strong>Journey Time Performance</strong>). In 2017, nearly 8 in 10 trips were running close to schedule; today, that figure has fallen closer to 7 in 10. For riders, that means longer waits, unpredictable service, and more frustration trying to get where they need to go.<br><br>
                                Behind the statistics are daily stories of missed appointments, late arrivals to work, and longer commutes. The steady increase in <strong>Additional Bus Stop Time</strong> and <strong>Additional Travel Time</strong> reflects the grind of congestion and uneven service, while the drop in <strong>Journey Time Performance</strong> and <strong>Avg Wait Assessment</strong> shows how reliability has slipped away. For the average bus rider, these aren't abstract trends—they're the minutes lost waiting in the cold, the stress of buses arriving in bunches, and the erosion of trust in a service millions depend on. This story is about more than just buses; it's about the widening gap between what New Yorkers need from transit and what they are actually getting.

                            <h3>A System in Crisis</h3>
                            <p>
                                The data reveals a <strong>transit system in full-blown crisis</strong>. Fare evasion now touches <strong>nearly half of all bus trips</strong>, ridership has plummeted <strong>45% over two decades</strong>, and <strong>half of NYC’s bus routes crawl slower than 7 mph</strong>. This is more than statistics—it’s a story of <strong>eroded trust</strong> and a <em>social contract around public transit that has broken down</em>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The pandemic sped up these trends, but the roots run deep: a system built on <strong>outdated assumptions</strong>, slowed by congestion, and increasingly disconnected from the realities of <strong>working-class New Yorkers</strong> who make up the majority of riders.

                            <h3>Beyond Transportation</h3>
                            <p>
                                The consequences go far beyond buses. When service fails, it <strong>deepens inequality</strong>, <em>stealing precious time from those who can least afford to lose it</em>, and limits access to opportunity for communities already pushed to the margins. The MTA faces a choice: continue <em>managing decline with incremental fixes and fare enforcement</em>, or confront that <strong>the current model is fundamentally unsustainable</strong>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Real solutions require more than faster buses or better fare collection—they demand <strong>reimagining public transit as a true public service</strong>, one that <em>prioritizes access over revenue</em> and recognizes that <strong>mobility is not a luxury, but a basic necessity</strong>. Without such transformation, New York risks losing not just riders, but the promise of a city where everyone can <strong>move freely and participate fully in its economic and social life</strong>.
