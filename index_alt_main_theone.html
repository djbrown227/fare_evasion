            <p class="hero-subtitle">Buses may be slower and often stuck in traffic, but they remain essential for millions—linking neighborhoods the subway doesn't reach and serving as a lifeline for those who depend on transit. Yet fare evasion, sluggish speeds, and rising costs raise a pressing question: how well is the system working for New Yorkers?</p>

                                The NYC bus network faces multiple pressures: ridership is still recovering from the pandemic, fare evasion is climbing, speeds are declining, and costs remain high. At the same time, redesigns and expanded bus lanes suggest ways the system can improve. This report examines buses through four lenses—ridership, performance, efficiency, and finances—to show how the network is performing and where it can be strengthened.

                <p class="section-intro">Fare evasion on NYC buses has surged to record levels, with nearly half of all riders now boarding without paying. This shift has created a two-tier system, where paying passengers are often the minority. The increase—from around 20% pre-pandemic to over 44% today—reflects economic strain, limited enforcement, and outdated fare systems, especially on local routes.
                    Despite efforts like EAGLE Teams and awareness campaigns, evasion remains high. These patterns suggest enforcement alone won't solve the problem.</p>

                            <h3>Long-Term Decline</h3>
                            <p>Bus ridership in New York City has been in steady decline for more than two decades. 
                            Daily riders have dropped from nearly 2 million in 2002 to just about 1.1 million in 2024 — a loss of roughly 45%. 
                            This persistent decline reflects lasting shifts in commuting patterns, competition from cars and ride-hailing, and service reliability issues.</p>
                            
                            <p>Brooklyn continues to account for the highest bus ridership, while Staten Island carries the lowest. 
                            These borough-level differences highlight both the essential role buses play in certain communities and the uneven impact of ridership losses across the city.</p>

                            <h3>Pandemic and Aftermath</h3>
                            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these long-term declines. Despite partial recovery, ridership remains far below pre-2019 levels. 
                            Daily bus trips hover around 1.4 million, but commuting patterns have permanently shifted with the rise of remote work and reduced weekday demand.</p>
                            
                            <p>Unlike other transit systems that rely more heavily on subsidies, the MTA depends significantly on farebox revenue. 
                            This means falling ridership translates directly into financial pressure. Even with projected fare and toll increases through 2027–28, pricing alone cannot close the gap — ridership losses are structural, not temporary. 
                            The challenge for the MTA is not simply restoring old patterns, but adapting service to meet new realities.</p>

                    <p>Bus ridership in New York has not just dipped — it has reshaped itself over time. The numbers reveal a long downward trend that predates the pandemic, with the COVID years accelerating changes in commuting behavior and reducing weekday demand.</p>
                    
                    <p>The following charts break this story into three perspectives: overall ridership decline, how weekday ridership today compares with pre-pandemic norms, and how both weekday and weekend patterns deviate from long-term averages. Together, they highlight the scale and persistence of change the MTA must adapt to.</p>

                        <p class="section-intro">Fare evasion on NYC buses has surged to record levels, with nearly half of all riders now boarding without paying. This shift has created a two-tier system, where paying passengers are often the minority. The increase—from around 20% pre-pandemic to over 44% today—reflects economic strain, limited enforcement, and outdated fare systems, especially on local routes.
                            Despite efforts like EAGLE Teams and awareness campaigns, evasion remains high. These patterns suggest enforcement alone won't solve the problem.</p>
